Telegram bot [@isael_ayuda_bot](https://t.me/isael_ayuda_bot) is a Telegram bot created by Isael Diroche to manage a group, provide information, handle data, and facilitate repetitive actions. It was created around August 2021, although the idea had emerged a bit earlier. Deploying it was a hassle, but this project was motivated by the bot [@Jonathanitlabot](https://t.me/Jonathanitlabot).
